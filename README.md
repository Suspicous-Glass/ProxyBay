My data is not for sale

I saw my data Getting stolen on reddit and decided to do something about it.
I built my own reddit through a bot and the PRAW api.

I used flask to upload it to localhost, and I might consider uploading it to the internet.

I like to call what I did "Leech Programming." My server takes all of the information from a host website and all it has to do is display text and images. No DB logging, no images to save, I took a bot framework and completely juiced it for all it could do.

I began this project when I was 14. As a 16 year old, I saw that the reddit API was becoming restricted. I am now (writing still as a 16 year old) using this old github as a playground to get around Reddit's new tyrannical TOS.

Looking at the code, I am also realizing that this whole thing is pretty scuffed, and I will be making changes to the javascript to make it run faster.
