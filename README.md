My data is not for sale.

I saw my data Getting stolen on reddit and decided to do something about it.
I built my own reddit through a bot and the PRAW api.

I used flask to upload it to localhost, and I might consider uploading it to the internet.

I like to call what I did "Leech Programming." My server takes all of the information from a host website and all it has to do is display text and images. No DB logging, no images to save, I took a bot framework and completely juiced it for all it could do.

UPDATE:

I began this project when I was 14.
Reddit's API rules have changed and the code no longer works because of it. 
Maybe one day a work around will leak on fourums but until then we're stuck.
Looking at the code, I am also realizing that this whole thing is pretty scuffed, but I have learned to make better code since then.
